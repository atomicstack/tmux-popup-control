## Cross-session notes:

This is a section which can be used as a cross-session scratchpad to carry any
useful information needed about the work or the execution environment.

- there is a local checkout of the tmux-fzf repository in /tmp/tmux-fzf you can
  use as a reference implementation
- During agentic work, in the shell the python interpreter is named python3
  (though the use of Perl is preferable to other scripting languages)
